#School recommendation system 


##Task description 
Our task is to develop a recommendation engine to assist families who are relocating to Phoenix and seeking suitable K-12 schools for their children. Due to time and resource constraints, these families are unable to thoroughly research all available options. The “recommendation” engine will utilize data mining techniques to identify the top 5 schools that are most similar to a given school, based on key attributes. 
To achieve this, we will evaluate various models such as KNN, RNN, and others, and select the most suitable approach. The data attributes that we will collect on Phoenix K-12 schools include standardized test scores, racial/economic demographics, extracurricular programs, facilities/resources, popularity/demand, rating, and location, among others.

##Benefit of Solving Selected Problem
Schooling is a very important aspect of a student’s life. By solving this problem, we aim to provide top 5 choices of similar schools in the Phoenix metropolitan area for students to choose from.
We will be able to suggest similar schools for a student if he/she doesn’t get into their favorite school. As a school student being involved in extracurriculars plays an important role hence parents and the student who prefer a balance between education, sports and extracurriculars can make a better choice. They can also choose between aspects like location, scholarships provided, distance and commuting options, peers (which school the student’s friends are joining), and lastly the campus environment in which the student will thrive and learn.
