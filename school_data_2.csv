We have several interventions in place for our struggling students. We also provide our AVID program to help students who might not be ready for our advanced programs, but still need to be pushed to increase their understanding. Our foreign language program continues to prepare students for college and our ever-changing culture. We are very excited to offer a robust CTE program that gives our students technical skills and competitive advantage as they graduate from DEHS. The strong arts programs at Desert Edge have made us known in the City of Goodyear as student talent is acquired for community events and throughout the state of Arizona. Campus technology is fully one-to-one; each student is issued a chromebook for classroom use. The comprehensive academic programs we provide truly seek to make all DEHS students college and career ready.']","['Badminton', 'Baseball', 'Basketball', 'Cross-Country', 'Football', 'Golf', 'Soccer', 'Softball', 'Spirit/Cheerleading', 'Swimming', 'Tennis', 'Track and Field', 'Volleyball', 'Wrestling', 'Others', 'chevron_right', ""Women's Beach Volleyball"", 'chevron_right', ""Men's Indoor Volleyball"", 'chevron_right', 'Girls Flag Football', ""At DEHS we strive to build a comprehensive menu of athletic opportunities for our students to enhance their educational experience.

We've also developed several individual sport programs including golf and tennis. We are excited that we have been able to expand our programs to include some sports that are not typically offered in local high schools. We now have badminton, beach volleyball and boys court volleyball. We also have large programs for sports that have both individual components but are team based in track & field, swim & dive, and wrestling.

On the performance side, students could sing in one of our choirs, play in our band, act in our theater or perform with our dance classes. Many of these programs have garnered statewide and national recognitions while students have multiple opportunities to compete.
